In the world of engineering, **technical skills are the true weapons** that empower an individual to solve complex problems, innovate, and build impactful solutions.  
Just as a *Yodhya* (warrior) enters the battlefield equipped with weapons and scriptures, a technologist steps into challenges equipped with tools, languages, and frameworks.

I consider myself a lifelong learner and an evolving engineer. These are some of the **technological tools and languages** I have sharpened over time, and I continue to explore new ones each day to strengthen my arsenal.

✍️ My Hobbies
Having a hobby is a powerful way to enhance both personal and professional life. It not only brings joy and entertainment but also contributes to mental well-being and overall growth.
For me, hobbies are a source of inspiration, creativity, and balance.

One of my favorite hobbies is reading — I enjoy exploring a wide range of books, from self-improvement and productivity to technology and biographies. Reading helps me gain new perspectives, stay updated with trends, and continuously grow as a person.

Another passion of mine is writing. I've recently started sharing my thoughts and learnings through articles and blogs, hoping to turn this hobby into something more impactful.
Expressing ideas through words not only improves communication but also helps in connecting with like-minded individuals across the world.
